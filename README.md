## ***Task 1 answer:***   
  
An app will execute a function either on page load or via user interaction. 
Our app would then dispatch a fetch function, where it will request the data, and provide a response.
Assuming we got an OK 200 response, and the data was provided in json format.
Our app would then trigger an action which would add the data to the redux store.
This is followed by a corresponding state update which makes the newly fetched data, available in our redux state.
The new state object then will reflect on the front end, providing our UI components are well integrated with the redux state. We can then access this state from anywhere in the application and this will save us prop drilling as the application grows.
  
**How redux works in 4 lines (Something I wrote a few years ago to simplify explaining redux to a junior dev):**  
  
An app provides a function,  
that triggers an action,  
that returns a type,  
that replaces state
